### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jie, and I think a lot, code, and design things urban.

- ðŸŽ“ I'm an urban design student in UPenn's Master of City Planning program.
- ðŸ”¢ But compared to pure design, I prefer to do spatial stastics and build spatial data products...
- ðŸ‘€ ... and data viz, story-telling, and map making.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [li.jie.urban@gmail.com](mailto:li.jie.urban@gmail.com)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a coffee addict and I always want to study linguistics some day.

My highlight projects:

- **Mobiladelphia**: Desktop-oriented web app that helps navigating travel data, answering questions like "How do people depart from Rittenhouse Square for shopping? Do they walk most often?".

- [Mobile Philly](http://jieliurban.com/): Analyzing and visualizing Philadelphia's mobility using the newest Python technologies, e.g., holoviz (hvplot, datashader, etc.) and altair.
