### Hi there 👋

My name is Jie, and I think a lot, code, and design things urban.

- 🎓 I'm an urban design student in UPenn's Master of City Planning program.
- 🔢 But compared to pure design, I prefer to do spatial stastics and build spatial data products...
- 👀 ... and data viz, story-telling, and map making.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to do web development to wrap up my spatial data tools as well!
- 💬 Ask me about coding in R, geospatial statistics, data viz, and map making.
- 📫 How to reach me: [li.jie.urban@gmail.com](mailto:li.jie.urban@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a coffee addict and I always want to study linguistics some day.
